pmwiki-trello
=============

Simple [Trello](https://trello.com) integration for [PmWiki](http://www.pmwiki.org).

Currently, a bare-bones markup that uses the Trello-provided demo app [Reading all the cards a member is assigned to](http://jsfiddle.net/nNesx/).
Also currently requires that jQuery has already been included on the page

As of 2013.06.11 this is a proof-of-concept, with plans for expansion.

## Installation
Download pmwiki-trello.php, copy to cookbook folder, and add to config.php:

    include_once('$FarmD/cookbook/pmwiki-trello.php');

Update your API Key (which you can get at https://trello.com/1/appKey/generate)


## Roadmap
- inclusion of jQuery (as required)
- Better CSS
- List Boards
- Add Card
- Better documentation on API-key
- Better handling of inputting API-key
