pmwiki-trello
=============

Simple trello integration for the PmWiki engine

Currently, a bare-bones markup that uses the Trello-provided demo app [Reading all the cards a member is assigned to](http://jsfiddle.net/nNesx/)
Also currently requires that jQuery has already been included on the page

As of 2013.06.11 this is a proof-of-concept, with plans for expansion.
